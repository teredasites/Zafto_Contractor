      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wet pipe systems have water in all piping under pressure at all times. When a sprinkler activates, water discharges immediately. This is the most common and reliable type.",

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Dry pipe systems contain air or nitrogen under pressure. This air pressure holds the dry pipe valve closed, keeping water out of the piping.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Preaction systems are dry systems with a preaction valve that must be opened by a detection system before water enters the piping. This provides extra protection against accidental discharge.",

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Deluge valves are activated by a separate fire detection system (heat or smoke detectors) or manually, since the sprinklers themselves have no thermal elements.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Dry pipe valves typically have a 5:1 or 6:1 differential, meaning 1 psi of air pressure holds back 5-6 psi of water pressure due to the clapper area design.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Single interlock preaction requires only the detection system to activate for the preaction valve to open. Sprinkler activation then discharges water.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "If air leakage causes pressure to drop enough, the dry valve will trip and fill the system with water. This is called a false trip and requires investigation.",
