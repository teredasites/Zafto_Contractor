      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In 2:1 roping, the car moves half the distance that the rope moves at the machine sheave. This doubles the lifting force but halves the speed.",

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Compensation chains or ropes balance the varying weight of hoisting ropes as the car moves. Without compensation, the unbalanced rope weight affects system balance.",
