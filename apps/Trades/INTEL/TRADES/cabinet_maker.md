## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Sheet Goods Optimization

**Panel Yield**
```
Sheets needed = (Total parts area / Sheet area) × (1 + Waste factor)

Standard sheet: 4' × 8' = 32 sq ft
Half sheet: 4' × 4' = 16 sq ft

Waste factor: 15-30% depending on optimization
```

**Linear Footage to Sheets**
```
For 12" deep parts:
Parts from one sheet = 8 (ripped 4 ways, cut in half)

For 24" deep parts:
Parts from one sheet = 4 (ripped 2 ways, cut in half)
```

### Cabinet Dimensions

**Base Cabinet Standards**
```
Height: 34.5" (without countertop)
Depth: 24" (standard)
Toe kick: 4.5" high × 3" deep
Counter height: 36" (with 1.5" countertop)

Width: 9", 12", 15", 18", 21", 24", 27", 30", 33", 36", etc.
```

**Wall Cabinet Standards**
```
Height: 30", 36", 42" common
Depth: 12" (standard), 15", 24" for over-fridge
Bottom of cabinet: 18" above counter (54" AFF)
```

**Tall Cabinet Standards**
```
Height: 84", 90", 96"
Depth: 12" (pantry), 24" (oven)
```

### Face Frame Calculations

**Face Frame Dimensions**
```
Stile width: 1.5" - 2.25" typical
Rail width: 1.5" - 2.25" typical

Total face frame width = Opening + (2 × Stile width)
Overlay: 1/2" to 1.25" per side (full overlay)
```

**Door Size (Overlay)**
```
Door width = Opening + (2 × Overlay) - Gap
Door height = Opening + (2 × Overlay) - Gap

Gap: typically 1/8" between doors
```

### Drawer Calculations

**Drawer Box Dimensions**
```
Width = Opening - 1" (for slides)
Depth = Cabinet depth - 1" to 2" (for clearance)
Height = As designed
```

**Drawer Slide Selection**
```
100 lb rating: Standard
150 lb rating: Heavy duty
200+ lb rating: File drawers, heavy storage

Full extension vs 3/4 extension
```

### Hardware Spacing

**Handle/Pull Placement**
```
Base cabinet doors: 2.5" - 3" from top corner
Wall cabinet doors: 2.5" - 3" from bottom corner
Drawers: Centered, or 2.5" - 3" from top

European spacing: 32mm system
```

**Hinge Placement**
```
From edge: 3" - 4" from top and bottom
Additional hinges: Every 32" or 40"
Doors over 40": Add third hinge
```

### Material Costs

**Board Footage**
```
BF = (Thickness × Width × Length) / 144

Where all dimensions in inches
```

**Sheet Pricing**
```
Cost per sq ft = Sheet price / 32
Part cost = (Part area / 32) × Sheet price
```

### Kitchen Layout

**Work Triangle**
```
Sum of three legs: 13' - 26'
Each leg: 4' - 9'
No leg crosses island/peninsula
```

**Standard Dimensions**
```
Aisle width: 42" min (36" min for one cook)
Island clearance: 42" - 48" on working sides
Counter depth: 25" - 26" with overhang
```

## NOTES

- AWI standards are the quality benchmark
- Custom vs semi-custom vs stock = different markets
- CNC and software (Cabinet Vision, Mozaik) common in production shops
- European 32mm system is industry standard for hardware
- Frameless (European) vs face frame (traditional) construction
- Finishing is often separate specialty
- Installation is often separate from fabrication
- Lead times can be 4-12 weeks for custom work
