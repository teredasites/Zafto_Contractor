## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Motor Sizing
**HP Required for Traction Elevator**
```
HP = (W × V) / (33,000 × η)

Where:
- HP = Motor horsepower
- W = Total load (car + passengers + counterweight deficit) in lbs
- V = Speed in ft/min
- η = Efficiency (typically 0.80-0.85)
- 33,000 = ft-lbs per minute per HP
```

**Simplified:**
```
HP = (Capacity × Speed) / 20,000 (rule of thumb)
```

### Counterweight
**Counterweight Calculation**
```
CW = Car Weight + (Capacity × 0.40 to 0.50)

Where:
- CW = Counterweight (lbs)
- Capacity = Rated capacity (lbs)
- 40-50% = Typical balance percentage
```

### Hydraulic Systems
**Cylinder Force**
```
F = P × A

Where:
- F = Force (lbs)
- P = Pressure (psi)
- A = Piston area (in²)
```

**Piston Area**
```
A = π × r² = π × (d/2)²

Where:
- d = Piston diameter (inches)
```

**Hydraulic Flow Rate**
```
GPM = (A × V) / 231

Where:
- GPM = Flow rate (gallons per minute)
- A = Piston area (in²)
- V = Speed (in/min)
- 231 = in³ per gallon
```

**Oil Volume**
```
V = A × Stroke

Where:
- V = Volume (in³)
- A = Cylinder area (in²)
- Stroke = Travel (in)
```

### Electrical Calculations
**Motor Current (3-Phase)**
```
I = (HP × 746) / (√3 × V × PF × η)

Where:
- I = Current (amps)
- HP = Motor horsepower
- V = Voltage (typically 208, 460, or 575V)
- PF = Power factor (typically 0.85)
- η = Efficiency
```

**Feeder Sizing (NEC 620.13)**
```
Feeder = (Largest Motor × 125%) + Sum of Other Motors
```

### Rope Calculations
**Rope Safety Factor**
```
SF = (Breaking Strength × Number of Ropes) / Maximum Load

Minimum SF:
- Passenger: 5.0
- Freight: 5.0
- Construction: 5.0
```

**Fleet Angle**
```
Angle = arctan(D / (2 × L))

Where:
- D = Sheave diameter
- L = Distance to fairlead

Maximum fleet angle: typically 4°
```

### Travel & Speed
**Travel Time**
```
T = D / V

Where:
- T = Time (seconds)
- D = Distance (feet)
- V = Speed (ft/sec) [convert from ft/min ÷ 60]
```

**Handling Capacity**
```
HC = (300 × Capacity × 60) / (RTT)

Where:
- HC = Handling capacity (persons/5 min)
- RTT = Round trip time (seconds)
- Capacity = Car capacity (persons)
```

### Governor & Safety
**Governor Tripping Speed**
```
For speeds ≤ 250 fpm: Tripping speed = rated speed + 40%
For speeds > 250 fpm: Per A17.1 formula
```

**Buffer Stroke (Oil Buffer)**
```
S = V² / (2 × a × g)

Where:
- S = Stroke (ft)
- V = Governor tripping speed (ft/sec)
- a = Deceleration (typically 1.0g max)
- g = 32.2 ft/sec²
```

## NOTES

- Very strong union presence (IUEC)
- 4-year apprenticeship is standard path
- Major manufacturers: Otis, Schindler, KONE, ThyssenKrupp, Mitsubishi
- Modernization work is growing as buildings age
- Work can be in extreme conditions (pits, machine rooms, on top of cars)
- On-call/emergency work is common and well-compensated
- Proprietary systems create specialization (you may only work on one brand)
