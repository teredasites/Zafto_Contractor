## KEY FORMULAS FOR CALCULATORS

### 1. SURFACE AREA CALCULATIONS

**Wall Area:**
```
Wall SF = (Perimeter × Height) - Openings

Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Standard Opening Deductions:
- Door: 21 SF (3' × 7')
- Window: 15 SF (average)
- Sliding door: 42 SF
```

**Ceiling Area:**
```
Ceiling SF = Length × Width
```

**Total Room Surface:**
```
Total SF = Wall SF + Ceiling SF + Trim LF equivalent
```

---

### 2. PAINT COVERAGE CALCULATIONS

**Gallons Needed:**
```
Gallons = Total SF / Coverage Rate / Number of Coats

Standard Coverage Rates (SF per gallon):
- Primer: 200-300 SF
- Flat paint: 350-400 SF
- Eggshell/Satin: 350-400 SF
- Semi-gloss: 350-400 SF
- Gloss: 350-400 SF
- Textured surfaces: 150-200 SF
- Rough/porous: 200-250 SF
```

**Coverage by Surface:**
```
Smooth drywall: 400 SF/gal
Textured drywall: 250-300 SF/gal
Brick: 150-200 SF/gal
Stucco: 100-150 SF/gal
Wood siding: 300-400 SF/gal
Concrete block: 100-150 SF/gal
```

---

### 3. EXTERIOR CALCULATIONS

**Siding Area:**
```
SF = Building Perimeter × Wall Height

Gable ends: Add triangle area
Triangle = (Base × Height) / 2
```

**Trim (Linear Feet to SF):**
```
Fascia SF = LF × Width
Soffit SF = LF × Width
Window trim SF = Perimeter × Width per window
Door trim SF = Perimeter × Width per door
```

**Exterior Coverage (per gallon):**
```
Smooth siding: 350-400 SF
Rough-sawn: 200-300 SF
Cedar shingles: 150-200 SF
Brick: 150-200 SF
Stucco: 100-150 SF
Concrete: 200-300 SF
```

---

### 4. PRIMER CALCULATIONS

**When to Prime:**
```
- New drywall: Always
- Bare wood: Always
- Stains: Always (stain-blocking)
- Color change (dark to light): Tinted primer
- Glossy surfaces: Bonding primer
```

**Primer Coverage:**
```
Standard primer: 200-300 SF/gal
Shellac-based: 100-150 SF/gal
PVA drywall: 300-400 SF/gal
Bonding primer: 300-350 SF/gal
```

---

### 5. TRIM & MILLWORK

**Linear Feet Approach:**
```
Coverage (LF/gal):
- Baseboard: 400-500 LF/gal
- Crown molding: 300-400 LF/gal
- Door casing: 400-500 LF/gal
- Window casing: 400-500 LF/gal
```

**Door Paint Calculation:**
```
Standard door (one side): 21 SF
Both sides + edges: 45 SF
6-panel door (both sides): 55-60 SF

Doors per gallon: 7-10 (both sides)
```

**Window Sash:**
```
Per window (interior + exterior): 8-12 SF
Windows per gallon: 30-40
```

---

### 6. CABINET PAINTING

**Cabinet Surface Area:**
```
Base cabinet (per LF): ~8 SF fronts
Upper cabinet (per LF): ~6 SF fronts

Full coverage (including interior):
Base: ~16 SF/LF
Upper: ~12 SF/LF
```

**Cabinet Coverage:**
```
Primer: 300-350 SF/gal
Paint: 350-400 SF/gal
Lacquer: 300-350 SF/gal
```

---

### 7. SPRAY VS BRUSH/ROLL

**Spray Coverage Factor:**
```
Overspray waste: 20-40% more material

Spray factor: Multiply brush/roll quantity × 1.3-1.5
```

**Production Rate Comparison:**
```
Brush: 50-100 SF/hour
Roller: 150-200 SF/hour
Airless spray: 300-500 SF/hour
HVLP spray: 150-250 SF/hour
```

### 8. DRY TIME CALCULATIONS

**Standard Dry Times (Interior):**

| Paint Type | Touch Dry | Recoat | Full Cure |
|------------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Latex flat | 30-60 min | 2-4 hrs | 30 days |
| Latex eggshell | 1-2 hrs | 2-4 hrs | 30 days |
| Latex semi-gloss | 1-2 hrs | 4 hrs | 30 days |
| Oil/Alkyd | 6-8 hrs | 16-24 hrs | 7-30 days |
| Lacquer | 15-30 min | 30-60 min | 24 hrs |
| Shellac | 15 min | 45-60 min | 3 days |

**Factors Affecting Dry Time:**
- Temperature: <50°F = double time
- Humidity: >70% = longer
- Film thickness: Thicker = longer
- Ventilation: More = faster

### 9. LABOR PRODUCTION RATES

**Interior (SF per hour per painter):**
```
Walls (brush/roll):
- Primer: 100-150 SF/hr
- Paint (1 coat): 150-200 SF/hr
- Paint (2 coats): 100-125 SF/hr

Ceilings:

- Door casing: 6-10 openings/hr
- Doors: 2-4 doors/hr (both sides)
```

**Exterior (SF per hour):**

Caulking: 100-150 LF/hr
```

---

### 10. ESTIMATING PAINT QUANTITIES

**Quick Room Estimate:**
```
Small room (10×12): 2-3 gallons
Medium room (12×14): 3-4 gallons
Large room (14×18): 4-5 gallons

Includes walls + ceiling + 2 coats
```

**Whole House Estimate:**
```
Interior: 1 gallon per 400 SF of floor space (walls only)
Add 0.5 gallon per 400 SF for ceilings
Add 1-2 gallons for trim throughout
```

---

### 11. MIXING & TINTING

**Custom Color Mixing:**
```
1 gallon = 128 oz
Tint limit: Usually 10-12 oz per gallon

Deep bases: Less white pigment, more tint capacity
Light bases: More white pigment, less tint capacity
```

**Box Mixing:**
```
Always box (mix multiple gallons) for consistency
Especially important for large walls, exteriors
```

---

### 12. WASTE & ORDER FACTORS

**Ordering:**
```
Add 10% waste factor minimum

Additional factors:
- Complex cut-ins: +10%
- Multiple colors: +10% per color
- Spray application: +30%
- Textured surfaces: +20%
```

**Minimum Order:**
```
Never order less than 1 gallon per room
Better to have leftover for touch-ups
```
