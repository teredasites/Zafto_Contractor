## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Electrical Troubleshooting

**Ohm's Law**
```
V = I × R
I = V / R
R = V / I
P = V × I = I²R = V²/R
```

**Wattage Check**
```
Actual watts = V_measured × I_measured
Compare to nameplate rating

If actual < rated: Problem in circuit
If actual > rated: Possible short or overload
```

**Resistance Testing**
```
Open circuit: Infinite ohms (OL)
Short circuit: 0 ohms
Normal: Within spec range

Heating element: Low ohms (10-50Ω typical)
Motor winding: Low ohms (1-20Ω typical)
```

### Refrigeration

**Superheat**
```
Superheat = T_suction_line - T_saturation

Target: 10-15°F for fixed orifice
Adjustable with TXV
```

**Subcooling**
```
Subcooling = T_saturation - T_liquid_line

Target: 10-15°F
```

**Temperature/Pressure Relationship**
```
Use PT chart for specific refrigerant

R-134a examples:
-20°F = 0.6 psig
0°F = 7.1 psig
20°F = 18.4 psig
40°F = 35.0 psig
```

**Refrigerant Charge**
```
By weight: Use scale, match nameplate
By superheat/subcooling: Adjust to target
```

### Motor Calculations

**Motor Current**
```
Single phase:
FLA = Watts / (Volts × PF × Efficiency)

Three phase:
FLA = Watts / (Volts × 1.732 × PF × Efficiency)
```

**Starting Current**
```
LRA (Locked Rotor Amps) = FLA × 4 to 6

Compare measured to nameplate LRA
```

**Capacitor Testing**
```
Rated vs measured microfarads
Acceptable range: ±10% of rated

Start capacitor: 70-300+ µF (short duty)
Run capacitor: 5-50 µF (continuous)
```

### Water/Drainage

**Water Flow**
```
GPM = Gallons / Minutes

Fill time test:
Expected GPM = Valve rating
Measure actual fill time
```

**Pump Output**
```
Drain pump: Check for proper flow
Circulation pump: Check pressure/flow
```

### Gas Appliances

**Gas Pressure**
```
Natural gas manifold: 3.5" W.C. typical
LP gas manifold: 10-11" W.C. typical

1" W.C. = 0.036 psi
```

**BTU Input**
```
BTU/hr = (Cubic feet gas × 1000) / Time in hours

Clock gas meter to verify
```

**Combustion Air**
```
50 cu ft per 1000 BTU/hr (confined space)
Or proper vent/air openings
```

- Manufacturer training increasingly important (complex electronics)
- Parts availability varies - older appliances harder to source
- Right to repair movement affecting parts/documentation access
- Smart appliances require network troubleshooting skills
- Repair vs replace decision is common customer question
- Liability concerns with gas appliances
- Independent vs brand-authorized service = different business models
- Truck stock management is critical for efficiency
