## OVERVIEW

**What they do:** Install and maintain high-pressure piping systems in industrial settings - power plants, refineries, chemical plants, manufacturing facilities. Different from plumbers who work on low-pressure water/waste systems.

**Market size:** ~130,000 pipefitters/steamfitters in US, strong demand in energy and industrial sectors.

**Why it matters for ZAFTO:** High-paying trade ($70-100k+), complex calculations, licensed in many jurisdictions, heavy code requirements.

**Calculator target:** 80-95 calculators

## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Pipe Dimensions

**Pipe Wall Thickness**
```
Schedule determines wall thickness, not OD

Common Schedules:
- Sch 5, 10 (light wall)
- Sch 40 (standard)
- Sch 80 (extra heavy)
- Sch 160, XXH (heavy)
```

**Pipe OD by Nominal Size**
| NPS | OD (inches) |
|-----|-------------|
| 1/2" | 0.840 |
| 3/4" | 1.050 |
| 1" | 1.315 |
| 1-1/4" | 1.660 |
| 1-1/2" | 1.900 |
| 2" | 2.375 |
| 3" | 3.500 |
| 4" | 4.500 |
| 6" | 6.625 |
| 8" | 8.625 |
| 10" | 10.750 |
| 12" | 12.750 |

### Offset Calculations

**Simple Offset**
```
Travel = Offset / sin(θ)
Run = Offset / tan(θ)

Common angles:
45°: Travel = Offset × 1.414
30°: Travel = Offset × 2.000
60°: Travel = Offset × 1.155
22.5°: Travel = Offset × 2.613
```

**Rolling Offset (3D)**
```
True Offset = √(Offset₁² + Offset₂²)
Travel = True Offset / sin(θ)
```

### Takeout & Makeup

**90° Elbow Takeout**
```
Takeout = Center-to-Face distance

Long radius (LR): Takeout = 1.5 × NPS
Short radius (SR): Takeout = 1.0 × NPS
```

**45° Elbow Takeout**
```
LR 45°: Takeout = 0.625 × NPS (approx)
```

**Fitting Makeup**
```
Pipe Cut Length = Face-to-Face - (2 × Takeout) + (2 × Thread Engagement)
```

### Pressure & Flow

**Pipe Pressure Rating (Barlow's Formula)**
```
P = (2 × S × t) / (OD × SF)

Where:
- P = Internal pressure (psi)
- S = Allowable stress (psi)
- t = Wall thickness (inches)
- OD = Outside diameter (inches)
- SF = Safety factor
```

**Flow Velocity**
```
V = (0.408 × Q) / d²

Where:
- V = Velocity (ft/sec)
- Q = Flow rate (GPM)
- d = Inside diameter (inches)
```

**Pressure Drop (Darcy-Weisbach)**
```
ΔP = (f × L × V²) / (2 × g × D)

Where:
- f = Friction factor
- L = Pipe length
- V = Velocity
- D = Diameter
```

### Thermal Expansion

**Linear Expansion**
```
ΔL = α × L × ΔT

Where:
- ΔL = Change in length (inches)
- α = Coefficient of expansion (in/in/°F)
- L = Original length (inches)
- ΔT = Temperature change (°F)

Common α values:
- Carbon steel: 6.5 × 10⁻⁶
- Stainless steel: 9.6 × 10⁻⁶
- Copper: 9.8 × 10⁻⁶
```

**Expansion Loop Leg Length**
```
L = √(3 × E × D × ΔL / (144 × S))

Where:
- E = Modulus of elasticity (psi)
- D = Pipe OD (inches)
- ΔL = Total expansion (inches)
- S = Allowable stress (psi)
```

### Welding Calculations

**Weld Joint Preparation**
```
Bevel angle: typically 37.5° each side (75° included)
Root opening: 1/16" to 1/8"
Root face (land): 1/16" to 1/8"
```

**Weld Metal Volume**
```
For V-groove butt weld:
V = 0.5 × tan(θ) × (OD² - ID²) × reinforcement factor
```

**Preheat Requirements**
Based on:
- Material P-number
- Wall thickness
- Carbon equivalent

## NOTES

- Strong union presence (United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters)
- Industrial pipefitter ≠ plumber (different codes, higher pressures)
- Welding certification (ASME Section IX) is critical
- Shutdown/turnaround work is lucrative (refineries)
- Nuclear pipefitting is specialty with additional requirements
- Travel to job sites is common
- TWIC card required for ports/refineries
