## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Tile Quantity

**Tiles Needed**
```
Tiles = (Area / Tile area) × (1 + Waste factor)

Waste factors:
- Straight lay: 10%
- Diagonal: 15%
- Complex patterns: 15-20%
- Natural stone: 15-20%
```

**Square Feet to Tiles**
```
For 12"×12" tiles: Tiles = Sq ft × 1
For 6"×6" tiles: Tiles = Sq ft × 4
For 12"×24" tiles: Tiles = Sq ft × 0.5 × (144/288)
```

**General Formula**
```
Tiles = (L × W) / (tile_L × tile_W) × waste_factor

Where all dimensions in same units (inches or feet)
```

### Mortar/Thinset Coverage

**Thinset Coverage (sq ft per bag)**
| Trowel Size | Coverage (50 lb bag) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1/4" × 1/4" | 95-100 sq ft |
| 1/4" × 3/8" | 70-75 sq ft |
| 1/2" × 1/2" | 50-55 sq ft |
| 3/4" × 3/4" | 35-40 sq ft |

**Bags Needed**
```
Bags = Area / Coverage per bag × 1.10
```

### Grout Coverage

**Grout Quantity**
```
Grout (lbs) = (L + W) × D × J × 1.86 / (L × W)

Where:
- L = Tile length (inches)
- W = Tile width (inches)
- D = Tile depth/thickness (inches)
- J = Joint width (inches)
- 1.86 = constant for sanded grout
```

**Approximate Coverage (25 lb bag)**
| Tile Size | 1/8" joint | 1/4" joint |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 4"×4" | 60-70 sf | 30-35 sf |
| 6"×6" | 90-100 sf | 45-50 sf |
| 12"×12" | 180-200 sf | 90-100 sf |
| 12"×24" | 200-220 sf | 100-110 sf |

### Layout Calculations

**Centering Layout**
```
Start point = (Wall length - (Whole tiles × Tile width)) / 2

If result < 1/2 tile, shift layout
```

**Diagonal Layout**
```
Diagonal tile width = Tile size × 1.414
Cuts at perimeter = 45° miters
```

**Pattern Repeats**
```
For brick/offset: Offset = Tile length / 2 (typical)
For herringbone: 45° cuts at perimeter
```

### Substrate Requirements

**Deflection**
```
Floor deflection: L/360 max for ceramic
L/720 recommended for natural stone

L = span in inches
360 means 1" deflection per 360" span
```

**Membrane Coverage**
```
Uncoupling membrane: Add 10% for overlaps
Waterproofing: Per manufacturer specs
```

### Trim & Transitions

**Bullnose Quantity**
```
Pieces = Perimeter / Tile length × 1.10
```

**Schluter/Metal Edge**
```
Length = Perimeter + waste
Corners = Count + spares
```

## NOTES

- Certified Tile Installer (CTI) is the primary industry credential
- TCNA Handbook is the installation bible
- Large format tile (LFT) requires specialized techniques
- Waterproofing is critical in wet areas
- Natural stone requires different approach than ceramic
- Lippage (uneven edges) is common quality issue
- Crack isolation important over concrete
- Heated floor systems add complexity
