## KEY FORMULAS FOR CALCULATORS

### 1. BOARD FOOT CALCULATIONS

**Board Foot Definition:**
```
1 Board Foot = 1" × 12" × 12" = 144 cubic inches
```

**Board Foot Formula:**
```
BF = (Thickness" × Width" × Length') / 12

Or: BF = (T × W × L) / 144 (all dimensions in inches)

Example:
2×6×10' = (2 × 6 × 10) / 12 = 10 BF
```

**Nominal vs Actual Dimensions:**
| Nominal | Actual (Dry Lumber) |
|---------|---------------------|
| 1× | 3/4" |
| 2× | 1-1/2" |
| 4× | 3-1/2" |
| 6× | 5-1/2" |
| 8× | 7-1/4" |
| 10× | 9-1/4" |
| 12× | 11-1/4" |

---

### 2. LUMBER QUANTITY CALCULATIONS

**Studs for Wall:**
```
Number of Studs = (Wall Length / Spacing) + 1 + Extras

Extras:
- Door openings: +2 king studs, +2 jack studs per door
- Window openings: +2 king studs, +2 jack studs per window
- Corners: +3 per corner (California corner) or +4 (traditional)
- Intersections: +3 per T-wall
```

**Standard Spacing:**
```
16" OC: Wall Length (ft) × 0.75 + 1 = studs
24" OC: Wall Length (ft) × 0.50 + 1 = studs
```

**Plates:**
```
Single plate: Wall Length in linear feet
Double top plate: Wall Length × 2
Total plate LF = Wall Length × 3 (typical)
```

---

### 3. FLOOR JOIST CALCULATIONS

**Number of Joists:**
```
Joists = (Floor Length / Spacing) + 1

16" OC: Length (ft) × 0.75 + 1
24" OC: Length (ft) × 0.50 + 1
```

**Joist Length:**
```
Joist Length = Span + Bearing (typically 3" each end)
```

**Rim/Band Board:**
```
Linear Feet = Perimeter of floor system
```

**Blocking:**
```
Blocks = Number of joist bays (one per bay for mid-span blocking)
```

---

### 4. JOIST/RAFTER SPAN TABLES (IRC Reference)

**Floor Joist Maximum Spans (40 psf live, 10 psf dead) - #2 Grade:**

| Size | 16" OC | 24" OC |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2×6 SPF | 9'-11" | 8'-8" |
| 2×8 SPF | 13'-1" | 11'-5" |
| 2×10 SPF | 16'-8" | 14'-0" |
| 2×12 SPF | 19'-1" | 15'-7" |
| 2×6 Doug Fir | 10'-9" | 9'-5" |
| 2×8 Doug Fir | 14'-2" | 12'-4" |
| 2×10 Doug Fir | 18'-0" | 15'-2" |
| 2×12 Doug Fir | 21'-0" | 17'-2" |

**Note:** Always verify with adopted code edition - spans vary by edition

**Ceiling Joist Spans (10 psf live, 5 psf dead):**

| Size | 16" OC | 24" OC |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2×4 SPF | 9'-6" | 8'-3" |
| 2×6 SPF | 14'-11" | 13'-0" |
| 2×8 SPF | 19'-8" | 16'-2" |
| 2×10 SPF | 24'-0" | 19'-8" |

---

### 5. RAFTER CALCULATIONS

**Rafter Length (Mathematical):**
```
Rafter Length = √(Run² + Rise²)

Or: Rafter Length = Run × Pitch Multiplier

Pitch Multipliers:
4:12 = 1.054
5:12 = 1.083
6:12 = 1.118
7:12 = 1.158
8:12 = 1.202
9:12 = 1.250
10:12 = 1.302
12:12 = 1.414
```

**Total Rafter Length (with overhang):**
```
Total = Rafter Length + Overhang Length + Ridge Reduction

Ridge Reduction = 1/2 ridge board thickness (typically 3/4")
```

**Common Rafter Layout:**
```
Plumb Cut = Pitch angle
Seat Cut (Bird's Mouth) = 90° to plumb cut
Tail Cut = Plumb or square (as specified)
```

**Number of Rafters:**
```
Rafters = (Roof Length / Spacing) + 1 (per side)
Total = Rafters × 2 (for gable)
```

---

### 6. STAIR CALCULATIONS

**Code Requirements (IRC R311.7):**
```
Riser Height: 7-3/4" maximum
Tread Depth: 10" minimum
Nosing: 3/4" to 1-1/4"
Headroom: 6'-8" minimum
Width: 36" minimum
```

**Rise/Run Formula:**
```
Number of Risers = Total Rise / Target Riser Height
Actual Riser = Total Rise / Number of Risers

Example:
Total rise: 108" (9 feet)
Target riser: 7.5"
Risers = 108 / 7.5 = 14.4 → 14 risers
Actual riser = 108 / 14 = 7.71"
```

**Tread Calculation:**
```
Number of Treads = Number of Risers - 1

Total Run = Number of Treads × Tread Depth
```

**Stringer Length:**
```
Stringer = √(Total Rise² + Total Run²)

Or: Stringer = Total Run × Pitch Multiplier
```

**Rule of Thumb (Riser + Tread):**
```
Riser + Tread = 17" to 18" (comfortable)
(2 × Riser) + Tread = 24" to 25" (alternate formula)
```

---

### 7. HEADER SIZING

**Rule of Thumb (Non-engineered):**
```
Span up to 4': 2-2×6
Span 4'-6': 2-2×8
Span 6'-8': 2-2×10
Span 8'-10': 2-2×12
Span over 10': Engineered (LVL, steel)
```

**IRC Table R602.7 Header Spans (Building Width 36'):**

| Header Size | Ground Snow ≤30 psf | Ground Snow 30-50 psf |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 2-2×4 | 3'-0" | 2'-6" |
| 2-2×6 | 5'-0" | 4'-0" |
| 2-2×8 | 7'-0" | 5'-6" |
| 2-2×10 | 8'-0" | 7'-0" |
| 2-2×12 | 9'-0" | 8'-0" |

**Note:** Tables vary by building width, snow load, and code edition

---

### 8. SHEATHING CALCULATIONS

**Wall Sheathing:**
```
Sheets (4×8) = Wall Area / 32

Wall Area = Perimeter × Wall Height - Openings
Waste factor: 10-15%
```

**Roof Sheathing:**
```
Sheets = Roof Area / 32 × (1 + Waste)
Roof Area = Footprint × Pitch Multiplier
```

**Floor Sheathing:**
```
Sheets = Floor Area / 32 × (1 + Waste)
Typical waste: 5-10%
```

**Subfloor Tongue & Groove:**
```
Sheets = Floor Area / 32
Standard: 3/4" T&G for 16" OC joists
```

---

### 9. LOAD CALCULATIONS (Basic)

**Tributary Area:**
```
Tributary Width = Spacing / 2 (each side of member)
Tributary Area = Tributary Width × Span
```

**Point Load to Uniform Load:**
```
Equivalent UDL = (Point Load × 8) / Span
(for center point load)
```

**Common Design Loads:**
```
Floors (residential):
- Live: 40 psf
- Dead: 10-15 psf

Roof:
- Live: 20 psf (or snow load, whichever greater)
- Dead: 10-15 psf

Decks:
- Live: 40 psf
- Dead: 10 psf
```

---

### 10. FRAMING SQUARE CALCULATIONS

**Common Rafter Cut:**
```
Unit rise on tongue, 12 on blade
Mark along tongue for plumb cut
```

**Hip/Valley Factor:**
```
Unit length = √(12² + Rise²)
Hip/Valley unit length = √(17² + Rise²)

17 = √(12² + 12²) = diagonal of 12×12
```

**Stair Layout:**
```
Rise on tongue, run on blade
Mark along tongue for riser cut
Mark along blade for tread cut
```

---

### 11. DECK CALCULATIONS

**Joist Sizing:**
```
2×6: Spans to 8' (16" OC), 6' (24" OC)
2×8: Spans to 12' (16" OC), 10' (24" OC)
2×10: Spans to 15' (16" OC), 13' (24" OC)
2×12: Spans to 18' (16" OC), 16' (24" OC)
```

**Beam Sizing (Rule of Thumb):**
```
2-2×8: Up to 8' span, 6' joist span
2-2×10: Up to 10' span, 8' joist span
2-2×12: Up to 12' span, 10' joist span
```

**Post Sizing:**
```
4×4: Up to 8' height, light loads
6×6: Over 8' height or heavy loads
```

**Decking Material:**
```
5/4×6: 3.1 LF per SF
2×6: 2.1 LF per SF

Waste factor: 10-15%
```

**Fasteners:**
```
Screws: 350-400 per 100 SF of decking
Hidden fasteners: By manufacturer spec
```
