## KEY FORMULAS FOR CALCULATORS

### 1. AREA CALCULATIONS

**Rectangle:**
```
Area = Length × Width
```

**Triangle:**
```
Area = (Base × Height) / 2
```

**Circle:**
```
Area = π × r²
Area = 3.14159 × radius²
```

**Irregular Shapes:**
```
Break into rectangles/triangles
Or: Use offset method (average width × length)
```

---

### 2. MATERIAL CALCULATIONS

**Mulch/Soil Coverage:**
```
Cubic Yards = (Area SF × Depth inches) / 324

Example: 1,000 SF at 3" deep
= (1,000 × 3) / 324 = 9.26 CY
```

**Coverage by Depth:**
| Depth | CY per 100 SF |
|-------|---------------|
| 1" | 0.31 |
| 2" | 0.62 |
| 3" | 0.93 |
| 4" | 1.23 |
| 6" | 1.85 |

**Gravel/Stone:**
```
Tons = Cubic Yards × Material Weight Factor

Common Factors:
- Pea gravel: 1.4 tons/CY
- Crushed stone: 1.4 tons/CY
- River rock: 1.35 tons/CY
- Sand: 1.35 tons/CY
- Topsoil: 1.0-1.3 tons/CY
```

---

### 3. SOD CALCULATIONS

**Sod Needed:**
```
SF of sod = Area SF × 1.05 (5% waste)

Rolls (typical 2' × 5'): Area / 10
Pallets (typical 450-500 SF): Area / 450
```

**Preparation Materials:**
```
Starter fertilizer: 1 lb per 100 SF
Topsoil amendment: 1-2" depth over area
```

---

### 4. SEED CALCULATIONS

**Seed Rate:**
```
Pounds = Area SF × Rate per 1,000 SF / 1,000

Common Rates (lbs/1,000 SF):
- Kentucky Bluegrass: 2-3
- Perennial Ryegrass: 6-8
- Tall Fescue: 6-8
- Fine Fescue: 4-5
- Bermuda: 1-2
- Zoysia: 1-2
```

**Overseeding Rate:**
```
Typically 50% of new seeding rate
```

---

### 5. FERTILIZER CALCULATIONS

**Nitrogen Application:**
```
Lbs of product = (Desired N lbs/1,000 SF × Area/1,000) / (N% / 100)

Example: Apply 1 lb N per 1,000 SF using 24-0-12 fertilizer
= (1 × Area/1,000) / 0.24 = 4.17 lbs product per 1,000 SF
```

**Spreader Settings:**
```
Calibration: Collect and weigh material over known area
Adjust based on target rate
```

---

### 6. IRRIGATION CALCULATIONS

**Precipitation Rate:**
```
PR (in/hr) = (96.25 × GPM) / (Spacing × Row Spacing)

Where spacing is in feet
```

**Run Time:**
```
Minutes = Desired Application (inches) / PR × 60
```

**GPM Required:**
```
GPM = (Area SF × Application Rate) / (96.25 × Efficiency)

Efficiency:
- Spray heads: 50-70%
- Rotors: 70-80%
- Drip: 85-95%
```

**Pipe Sizing (Velocity Method):**
```
Max velocity: 5 fps recommended

Pipe Flow Capacity:
- 3/4" PVC: 6-8 GPM
- 1" PVC: 10-13 GPM
- 1.25" PVC: 17-22 GPM
- 1.5" PVC: 25-32 GPM
- 2" PVC: 45-58 GPM
```

**Sprinkler Spacing:**
```
Head-to-head coverage: 100% of radius
Triangle pattern: More efficient
Square pattern: Easier to install

Typical Spacing:
- Spray heads: 10-15 ft
- Rotors: 25-55 ft
```

---

### 7. PLANT CALCULATIONS

**Plants per Area:**
```
Plants = Area SF / (Spacing × Spacing)

Or for offset/staggered:
Plants = Area SF / (Spacing × Spacing × 0.866)
```

**Spacing Chart:**
| Spacing | Plants/100 SF |
|---------|---------------|
| 6" | 400 |
| 8" | 225 |
| 10" | 144 |
| 12" | 100 |
| 18" | 44 |
| 24" | 25 |
| 36" | 11 |

**Tree/Shrub Spacing:**
```
Consider mature spread
Typical minimum from structures: 3-5 ft
From property lines: varies by jurisdiction
```

---

### 8. HARDSCAPE CALCULATIONS

**Paver Area:**
```
Pavers = Area SF / Paver SF × 1.05-1.10 (waste)

Common Paver Sizes:
- 4×8: 0.22 SF each (4.5 per SF)
- 6×6: 0.25 SF each (4 per SF)
- 6×9: 0.375 SF each (2.67 per SF)
- 12×12: 1 SF each
```

**Base Material:**
```
CY = (Area SF × Depth inches) / 324

Typical depths:
- Pedestrian: 4" base
- Vehicular: 6-8" base
- Sand setting bed: 1"
```

**Edging:**
```
Linear feet = Perimeter + Internal edges
Add 10% for cuts and waste
```

---

### 9. RETAINING WALL CALCULATIONS

**Block Count:**
```
Blocks per SF of face = Varies by block size

Common:
- Standard (8" face): 1.125 per SF
- Large (12" face): 1 per SF
```

**Base Material:**
```
CY = (Wall Length × 2' width × 0.5' depth) / 27
```

**Backfill Gravel:**
```
CY = (Wall Length × 1' width × Wall Height) / 27
```

**Geogrid (if required):**
```
Layers = Wall Height / Vertical spacing
LF per layer = Wall Length × 1.1
```

---

### 10. DRAINAGE CALCULATIONS

**French Drain:**
```
Pipe: Linear feet + 10% for fittings
Gravel: CY = (LF × Trench Width × Trench Depth) / 27
Fabric: SF = LF × (Width + 2 × Depth) × 1.2 overlap
```

**Catch Basin Sizing:**
```
Based on drainage area and rainfall intensity
Typically 12" × 12" or 18" × 18" residential
```

**Slope for Drainage:**
```
Minimum: 1% (1/8" per foot)
Recommended: 2% (1/4" per foot)
```

---

### 11. LAWN CARE PRODUCTION RATES

**Mowing:**
```
Acres per hour = (Mower Width × Speed MPH × Efficiency) / 495

Efficiency: 70-80% typical (turns, obstacles)
```

**Application:**
```
Sprayer: 1-2 acres/hour (calibrated)
Spreader: 0.5-1 acre/hour
```
