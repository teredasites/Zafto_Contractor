## KEY FORMULAS FOR CALCULATORS

### 1. DEMOLITION CALCULATIONS

**Dumpster Sizing:**
```
Cubic Yards = Volume of debris / 27

Common Dumpster Sizes:
- 10 CY: Small bathroom/kitchen
- 20 CY: Medium remodel
- 30 CY: Large remodel/addition
- 40 CY: Whole house gut
```

**Debris Weight Estimates:**
```
Material          Lbs per CY
Drywall          500-800
Lumber           300-500
Concrete         2,000-4,000
Mixed demo       500-1,000
Roofing          450-600
```

**Demo Labor:**
```
Production Rates (SF per hour per worker):
- Drywall removal: 100-150 SF/hr
- Flooring removal: 50-100 SF/hr
- Framing demo: Varies widely
- Tile removal: 20-50 SF/hr
```

---

### 2. KITCHEN REMODEL CALCULATIONS

**Cabinet Linear Feet:**
```
Base cabinets: Perimeter - Appliances - Openings
Wall cabinets: Same, typically 50-70% of base
```

**Countertop:**
```
Square Feet = Linear Feet × Depth + Overhangs

Standard depth: 25.5" (including overhang)
Island: Add perimeter × overhang
```

**Backsplash:**
```
Square Feet = Linear Feet × Height (typically 18")
```

---

### 3. BATHROOM REMODEL CALCULATIONS

**Tile Quantities:**
```
Floor tile SF = Length × Width × 1.10 (10% waste)
Wall tile SF = Perimeter × Height × 1.15 (15% waste)
```

**Underlayment:**
```
Cement board: (SF / 15) sheets (3×5 sheets)
Membrane: SF × 1.10
```

**Fixtures per Bathroom:**
```
Standard full bath:
- 1 toilet
- 1 vanity (24"-72")
- 1 tub/shower
- 1 exhaust fan (50-80 CFM min)
```

---

### 4. WINDOW/DOOR REPLACEMENT

**Rough Opening:**
```
Window RO = Window size + 1/2" (each side) + 1/2" (top/bottom)
Door RO = Door size + 2" width + 2.5" height

Example: 3'-0" × 5'-0" window
RO = 36.5" × 60.5"
```

**Flashing/Tape:**
```
Linear feet = Perimeter of opening + 12" overlap
```

---

### 5. FLOORING CALCULATIONS

**Material Needed:**
```
SF needed = Room SF × Waste Factor

Waste Factors:
- Straight lay: 5-10%
- Diagonal: 15-20%
- Herringbone: 20-25%
- Complex room shapes: 15-20%
```

**Transition Strips:**
```
Linear feet = Doorway widths + Room transitions
```

---

### 6. PAINT CALCULATIONS (Interior)

**Wall Coverage:**
```
Wall SF = (Perimeter × Height) - Openings
Openings: ~21 SF per door, 15 SF per window
```

**Ceiling:**
```
Ceiling SF = Length × Width
```

**Gallons Needed:**
```
Gallons = Total SF / Coverage / Coats

Coverage: 350-400 SF per gallon typical
```

---

### 7. PERMIT FEE ESTIMATES

**Common Fee Structures:**
```
Percentage: 1-3% of project value
Flat fee: $50-$500 per permit
Per SF: $0.10-$0.50 per SF
```

**Permit Required (Typical):**
```
- Structural changes
- Electrical work
- Plumbing work
- HVAC work
- Window/door changes to openings
- Additions
```

**Often Exempt:**
```
- Painting
- Flooring (non-structural)
- Cabinets (no plumbing changes)
- Fixtures (like-for-like)
- Minor repairs
```

---

### 8. AGING-IN-PLACE/ADA CALCULATIONS

**Doorway Widths:**
```
ADA minimum: 32" clear opening
Recommended: 36" clear opening
Standard door in 36" RO: ~34" clear
```

**Grab Bar Placement:**
```
Toilet side: 42" long, 12" from rear wall
Behind toilet: 36" long, 6" above toilet
Shower: 33"-36" above floor
```

**Ramp Calculations:**
```
Length = Rise × 12 (for 1:12 slope)
Max rise per run: 30"
Landings: 60" × 60" minimum
```

---

### 9. STRUCTURAL OPENING CALCULATIONS

**Header Sizing (Rule of Thumb):**
```
Span up to 4': 2-2×6 or 2-2×8
Span 4'-6': 2-2×8 or 2-2×10
Span 6'-8': 2-2×10 or 2-2×12
Span 8'-10': 2-2×12 or engineered

Always verify with local code/engineer for load-bearing walls
```

**Post Sizing:**
```
Based on tributary load area
Typically 4×4 or 4×6 for residential
May need engineer approval
```

---

### 10. ENERGY EFFICIENCY CALCULATIONS

**Insulation R-Value:**
```
Heat Loss = Area × ΔT / R-value

Higher R = Less heat loss
```

**Window U-Factor:**
```
Lower U = Better insulation
U-factor = 1/R-value
```

**Air Sealing:**
```
ACH50 = Air changes per hour at 50 Pascals
Target: <5 ACH50 for tight house
Blower door test measures this
```
