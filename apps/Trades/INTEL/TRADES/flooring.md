## KEY FORMULAS FOR CALCULATORS

### 1. AREA CALCULATIONS

**Basic Room Area:**
```
Area (SF) = Length × Width
```

**Irregular Rooms:**
```
Break into rectangles
Area = Sum of all rectangle areas
```

**L-Shaped Room:**
```
Area = (L1 × W1) + (L2 × W2)
```

**Closets & Alcoves:**
```
Add separately to room total
```

---

### 2. MATERIAL QUANTITY WITH WASTE

**Total Material Needed:**
```
Material SF = Room SF × Waste Factor

Waste Factors by Installation:
- Straight lay: 1.05-1.10 (5-10%)
- Diagonal (45°): 1.15-1.20 (15-20%)
- Herringbone: 1.20-1.25 (20-25%)
- Random pattern: 1.10-1.15 (10-15%)
- Complex shapes: 1.15-1.20 (15-20%)
```

**Plank Flooring:**
```
Cartons = Material SF / SF per carton (round up)

Typical carton coverage:
- LVP: 20-30 SF/carton
- Laminate: 18-25 SF/carton
- Engineered: 15-25 SF/carton
- Hardwood: 20-25 SF/carton
```

---

### 3. HARDWOOD CALCULATIONS

**Board Foot vs Square Foot:**
```
Hardwood sold by:
- Square foot (finished flooring)
- Board foot (unfinished lumber)

1 BF = 1" × 12" × 12" (volume)
1 SF = 12" × 12" (area)
```

**Coverage by Width:**
```
Actual coverage less than nominal due to tongue

2-1/4" strip: 2-1/4" face = 2.25 SF per LF
3-1/4" plank: 3-1/4" face = 3.25 SF per LF

LF needed = SF ÷ Width (in feet)
```

**Nail/Staple Quantity:**
```
Fasteners = SF × Fasteners per SF

Typical: 4-6 per SF for 2-1/4" strip
Adjust for wider planks: Fewer per SF
```

**Sanding Abrasives:**
```
Sheets/roll per 100 SF:
- 36 grit: 8-10 sheets
- 60 grit: 6-8 sheets
- 80 grit: 4-6 sheets
- 100 grit: 3-4 sheets
- 120 grit: 2-3 sheets
```

**Finish Coverage:**
```
Stain: 500-700 SF/gal
Sealer: 400-500 SF/gal
Polyurethane: 500-600 SF/gal per coat

Typical: 3 coats finish = 150-200 SF/gal (total)
```

---

### 4. LAMINATE/LVP CALCULATIONS

**Cartons Needed:**
```
Cartons = (SF × Waste Factor) ÷ SF per carton

Round UP to whole cartons
```

**Underlayment:**
```
Rolls = SF × Overlap Factor ÷ Roll Coverage

Typical roll: 100-200 SF
Overlap: 4-6 inches = ~10% extra

Most underlayment: SF × 1.10 ÷ 100 = rolls
```

**Vapor Barrier:**
```
Required over concrete
6 mil poly: SF × 1.15 (15% overlap)
```

**Transition Pieces:**
```
T-molding: Between same-height floors
Reducer: To lower floors
End cap: Against vertical surfaces
Stair nosing: At stair edges

LF = Doorway widths + Room perimeters as needed
```

---

### 5. TILE CALCULATIONS

**Tiles per Square Foot:**
```
Tiles/SF = 144 ÷ (Tile Length" × Tile Width")

12×12: 1 tile/SF
6×6: 4 tiles/SF
18×18: 0.44 tiles/SF
12×24: 0.5 tiles/SF
24×24: 0.25 tiles/SF
```

**Total Tiles Needed:**
```
Tiles = SF × Tiles/SF × Waste Factor

Waste by pattern:
- Straight: 10%
- Diagonal: 15%
- Herringbone: 20%
- Mosaic: 10%
```

**Grout Coverage:**
```
Lbs = SF × Factor

Factor varies by tile size and joint width

Rule of thumb:
- 12×12 (1/8" joint): 1.5 lbs/10 SF
- 12×12 (1/4" joint): 3 lbs/10 SF
- Small mosaic: 5-8 lbs/10 SF
```

**Thinset Coverage:**
```
50 lb bag coverage (sq ft):

| Trowel Size | Coverage |
|-------------|----------|
| 1/4×1/4 | 100-120 SF |
| 1/4×3/8 | 70-80 SF |
| 3/8×3/8 | 55-65 SF |
| 1/2×1/2 | 40-50 SF |
```

**Cement Board:**
```
Sheets (3×5): SF ÷ 15 (round up)
Add 10% for cuts
```

---

### 6. CARPET CALCULATIONS

**Roll Goods:**
```
Standard widths: 12' and 15'

Layout = Minimize seams
Seam placement: Away from traffic

Carpet SF = Room SF + Seam allowance + Waste
```

**Carpet from Width:**
```
LF of carpet = Room length (in direction of roll)

Widths needed = Room width ÷ Roll width (round up)

Total SF = LF × Roll width × Widths
```

**Pattern Match:**
```
Pattern repeat waste: 5-10% additional

Pattern repeat = Manufacturer spec
Add one repeat per seam
```

**Pad/Cushion:**
```
SF = Carpet SF (same coverage needed)

Standard pad thickness:
- Residential: 7/16" - 1/2"
- Commercial: 3/8" or less
- Steps: 3/8" max
```

**Tackless Strip:**
```
LF = Perimeter - Doorways

Standard: 4' strips
Pieces = LF ÷ 4 (round up)
```

**Seaming Tape:**
```
LF = Total seam length
Add 10% for waste
```

---

### 7. VINYL SHEET CALCULATIONS

**Roll Widths:**
```
Standard: 6' and 12' widths
Some: 6', 9', 12', 15'
```

**Layout Planning:**
```
Minimize seams
Seams parallel to light source
Pattern match at seams
```

**Coverage:**
```
LF needed = Room length
Widths = Room width ÷ Roll width (round up)

Total SF = LF × Roll width × Number of widths
```

**Adhesive:**
```
Full spread: 1 gal per 40-60 SF
Perimeter: Much less (seams + edges only)
```

---

### 8. STAIR CALCULATIONS

**Tread Coverage:**
```
Tread SF = Tread depth × Tread width
Riser SF = Riser height × Tread width

Total per step = Tread + Riser + Nosing
```

**Stair Carpet:**
```
Stair width + Tuck (2× if tucked both sides)
LF per step = Tread + Riser + 2" tuck

Typical: 12" + 7.5" + 2" = 21.5" per step
```

**Stair Nosing:**
```
LF = Number of steps × Stair width
Pieces = Total LF ÷ Piece length
```

---

### 9. SUBFLOOR PREPARATION

**Leveling Compound:**
```
Bags per SF at depth:

1/8" average: 1 bag per 25 SF
1/4" average: 1 bag per 12 SF
1/2" average: 1 bag per 6 SF

Bag size: 25-50 lbs typical
```

**Plywood Underlayment:**
```
Sheets (4×8): SF ÷ 32

Typical: 1/4" lauan or 1/2" plywood
```

**Primer/Sealer:**
```
Coverage: 200-300 SF per gallon
```

---

### 10. RADIANT HEAT FLOORING

**Compatibility:**
```
Verify flooring rated for radiant heat
Max surface temp typically: 80-85°F

Best options:
- Tile/stone: Excellent
- Engineered wood: Good (verify)
- Laminate: Some products
- LVP: Some products
- Carpet: Reduces efficiency
```

**Acclimation Requirements:**
```
Run heat at 50% for 3+ days before install
Maintain during install
```
