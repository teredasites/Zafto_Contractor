## KEY FORMULAS FOR CALCULATORS

### 1. ENGINE DISPLACEMENT

**Displacement Formula:**
```
Displacement (ci) = (π/4) × Bore² × Stroke × Cylinders
Displacement (L) = Displacement (ci) / 61.024

Example:
4.00" bore × 3.48" stroke × 8 cylinders
= 0.7854 × 16 × 3.48 × 8 = 350 ci = 5.7L
```

**Bore/Stroke Ratio:**
```
B/S Ratio = Bore / Stroke

Oversquare: >1 (short stroke, high RPM)
Square: =1
Undersquare: <1 (long stroke, torque)
```

---

### 2. COMPRESSION RATIO

**Compression Ratio:**
```
CR = (Swept Volume + Clearance Volume) / Clearance Volume

Or: CR = (Vd + Vc) / Vc

Where:
Vd = Displacement per cylinder
Vc = Clearance volume (head + gasket + piston)
```

**Clearance Volume Calculation:**
```
Vc = (Vd) / (CR - 1)
```

**Effect of Head Milling:**
```
New CR = (Vd + Vc - ΔV) / (Vc - ΔV)

ΔV = Deck area × amount removed
```

---

### 3. HORSEPOWER & TORQUE

**Horsepower from Torque:**
```
HP = (Torque × RPM) / 5252

Example:
350 lb-ft @ 4000 RPM = (350 × 4000) / 5252 = 266 HP
```

**Torque from Horsepower:**
```
Torque = (HP × 5252) / RPM
```

**Wheel Horsepower (Dyno):**
```
WHP = Rear-wheel measured HP
BHP = WHP / Drivetrain efficiency

Typical efficiency:
- Manual FWD: 85-90%
- Manual RWD: 87-92%
- Automatic: 80-85%
- AWD: 75-85%
```

---

### 4. FUEL CALCULATIONS

**Air/Fuel Ratio:**
```
Stoichiometric gasoline: 14.7:1
Rich: <14.7:1 (more fuel)
Lean: >14.7:1 (less fuel)
```

**Lambda (λ):**
```
λ = Actual AFR / Stoichiometric AFR

λ = 1.0: Stoichiometric
λ < 1.0: Rich
λ > 1.0: Lean
```

**Injector Flow:**
```
Injector Size (lb/hr) = (HP × BSFC) / (Cylinders × Duty Cycle)

BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption):
- NA gasoline: 0.45-0.50
- Turbo gasoline: 0.55-0.65
- Diesel: 0.35-0.40

Max duty cycle: 80-85%
```

**Fuel Pump Sizing:**
```
Flow (gph) = HP / 10 (gasoline, rough estimate)
Flow (lph) = HP × 0.0167 × BSFC
```

---

### 5. ELECTRICAL CALCULATIONS

**Ohm's Law:**
```
V = I × R
I = V / R
R = V / I

V = Voltage (volts)
I = Current (amps)
R = Resistance (ohms)
```

**Power (Watts):**
```
P = V × I
P = I² × R
P = V² / R

P = Power (watts)
```

**Wire Sizing:**
```
Wire gauge based on current and length:

12V System:
10A @ 5ft: 16 gauge
10A @ 15ft: 12 gauge
20A @ 5ft: 14 gauge
20A @ 15ft: 10 gauge
```

**Voltage Drop:**
```
Vdrop = (2 × Length × Current × Resistance per ft)

Max acceptable: <0.5V or <3%
```

**Battery CCA Estimation:**
```
Minimum CCA = Engine displacement (L) × 100 (gas)
Minimum CCA = Engine displacement (L) × 200 (diesel)
```

---

### 6. TIRE/WHEEL CALCULATIONS

**Tire Diameter:**
```
Diameter (in) = (Section Width × Aspect Ratio × 2 / 25.4) + Rim Diameter

Example: 225/45R17
= (225 × 0.45 × 2 / 25.4) + 17 = 24.97"
```

**Tire Circumference:**
```
Circumference = π × Diameter
```

**Speedometer Correction:**
```
Actual Speed = Indicated Speed × (New Tire Diameter / Original Tire Diameter)

% Difference = ((New - Old) / Old) × 100
```

**Revolutions per Mile:**
```
Rev/Mile = 63,360 / (π × Diameter)

Or: Rev/Mile = 20,168 / Diameter (inches)
```

**Gear Ratio Effect:**
```
Final Drive Ratio = Ring Gear Teeth / Pinion Teeth
Overall Ratio = Transmission Ratio × Final Drive Ratio
```

---

### 7. BRAKE CALCULATIONS

**Brake Force:**
```
F = P × A

F = Force (lbs)
P = Line pressure (psi)
A = Piston area (sq in)
```

**Piston Area:**
```
A = π × r² = π × (D/2)²
```

**Master Cylinder Ratio:**
```
Pedal Ratio = Pedal travel / Pushrod travel
Output Force = Input Force × Pedal Ratio
```

**Brake Torque:**
```
Torque = Force × Effective Radius
```

**Brake Bias:**
```
Front % = (Front Brake Force / Total Force) × 100
Typical: 60-70% front
```

---

### 8. COOLING SYSTEM

**Coolant Capacity:**
```
Typically 1 gallon per 100 ci displacement (rough)
Check manufacturer specs
```

**Antifreeze Mix:**
```
Protection temperature by concentration:

30%: +8°F / -36°F boil
40%: -12°F / -23°F boil
50%: -34°F / +265°F boil
60%: -62°F / +270°F boil
70%: -84°F / +276°F boil (max recommended)
```

**Thermostat Opening:**
```
Standard: 195°F
Performance: 180°F
Heavy duty: 195-205°F
```

---

### 9. A/C SYSTEM CALCULATIONS

**Refrigerant Charge:**
```
Charge = Manufacturer specification (oz or grams)
Typical R-134a: 20-36 oz
Typical R-1234yf: 16-32 oz
```

**Pressure Relationships:**
```
Low side pressure: 25-45 psi (running)
High side pressure: 150-300 psi (varies with ambient)
```

**A/C Performance:**
```
Vent temp target: Ambient - 40°F (minimum)
Good performance: 35-45°F vent temp
```

---

### 10. ALIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS

**Camber:**
```
Positive: Top of tire tilts out
Negative: Top of tire tilts in
Typical: -0.5° to +0.5°
Performance: -1° to -2°
```

**Caster:**
```
Positive: Steering axis tilts rearward
Typical: +3° to +7°
Cross-caster: <0.5° difference
```

**Toe:**
```
Toe-in: Front of tires point inward
Toe-out: Front of tires point outward
Typical total: ±1/16" to ±1/8"
```

**Thrust Angle:**
```
Should be 0° (parallel to centerline)
Acceptable: <0.5°
```

---

### 11. LABOR TIME CALCULATIONS

**Flat Rate:**
```
Labor Cost = Labor Rate × Book Time

Book time sources:
- Chilton
- Mitchell
- ALLDATA
- Manufacturer
```

**Effective Labor Rate:**
```
Effective Rate = Total Labor Revenue / Total Hours Worked
Target: >100% of book time
```

**Shop Efficiency:**
```
Efficiency = Billed Hours / Clock Hours × 100
Target: 100-120%
```

---

### 12. PARTS MARKUP

**Standard Markup:**
```
Parts Markup = (Sell Price - Cost) / Cost × 100

Typical:
- General parts: 40-60% markup
- Specialty/dealer: 20-40% markup
- Fluids/filters: 50-100% markup
```

**Matrix Pricing:**
```
Low cost parts (<$10): 100-200% markup
Medium ($10-50): 60-100% markup
High ($50-200): 40-60% markup
Premium (>$200): 20-40% markup
```
