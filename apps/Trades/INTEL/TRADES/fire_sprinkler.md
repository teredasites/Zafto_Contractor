## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Hydraulic Calculations

**Hazen-Williams Formula (Primary for pipe friction loss)**
```
P = (4.52 × Q^1.85) / (C^1.85 × d^4.87)

Where:
- P = Friction loss (psi/ft)
- Q = Flow (gpm)
- C = Hazen-Williams coefficient (typically 120 for steel, 150 for CPVC)
- d = Internal pipe diameter (inches)
```

**Simplified Friction Loss**
```
Pf = (Q/K)² × L × F

Where:
- Pf = Friction loss (psi)
- Q = Flow (gpm)
- K = Pipe factor
- L = Equivalent pipe length (ft)
- F = Friction factor from tables
```

### Sprinkler Flow
**K-Factor Formula**
```
Q = K × √P

Where:
- Q = Flow (gpm)
- K = K-factor of sprinkler (gpm/psi^0.5)
- P = Pressure at sprinkler (psi)
```

**Common K-Factors:**
| K-Factor | Orifice Size | Typical Use |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 2.8 | 7/16" | Residential |
| 5.6 | 1/2" | Standard spray |
| 8.0 | 17/32" | Large orifice |
| 11.2 | 5/8" | Extra large orifice |
| 14.0 | 3/4" | ESFR |
| 16.8 | - | ESFR |
| 25.2 | 1" | ESFR |

### Design Area & Density
**Density (gpm/ft²)**
```
Density = Total Flow / Design Area

Light Hazard: 0.10 gpm/ft² over 1,500 ft²
Ordinary Group 1: 0.15 gpm/ft² over 1,500 ft²
Ordinary Group 2: 0.20 gpm/ft² over 1,500 ft²
Extra Hazard Group 1: 0.30 gpm/ft² over 2,500 ft²
Extra Hazard Group 2: 0.40 gpm/ft² over 2,500 ft²
```

### Pipe Sizing
**Pipe Schedule Method (Simplified)**
| Hazard | Max Sprinklers on Branch |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Light | 8 on 1", 18 on 1¼" |
| Ordinary | 5 on 1", 10 on 1¼" |

**Hydraulically Calculated:**
Must use Hazen-Williams to prove adequate pressure/flow.

### Hose Stream Allowance
| Hazard | Inside Hose (gpm) | Outside Hose (gpm) | Total (gpm) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Light | 0-50 | 100 | 100-150 |
| Ordinary | 0-50 | 250 | 250-300 |
| Extra | 0-50 | 500 | 500-550 |

### Elevation Pressure
```
P = 0.433 × H

Where:
- P = Pressure (psi)
- H = Height (ft)
- 0.433 psi/ft = pressure change per foot of elevation
```

### Water Supply
**Residual Pressure Method**
```
Flow available at required pressure calculated from hydrant flow test data
```

## NOTES

- Strong union presence (UA United Association)
- NICET certification often required by AHJ even without state license
- Hydraulic calculations are the core skill differentiator
- Software (like AutoSPRINK, HydraCAD) does heavy lifting but understanding is required
- "Fire watch" work during system impairments is common
- Cross-training with fire alarm is valuable
