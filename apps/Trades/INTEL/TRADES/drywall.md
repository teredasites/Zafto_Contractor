## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Sheet Coverage

**Drywall Sheets Needed**
```
Sheets = (Wall area + Ceiling area) / Sheet area × Waste factor

Standard sheet: 4' × 8' = 32 sq ft
Large sheet: 4' × 12' = 48 sq ft

Typical waste: 10-15%
```

**Lineal Feet to Sheets**
```
For 8' walls:
Sheets = Perimeter (LF) / 4 × 1.10
```

### Framing Counts

**Studs Required**
```
Studs = (Wall length / Spacing) + 1 + corners + openings

16" OC: Studs = (Length in inches / 16) + 1
24" OC: Studs = (Length in inches / 24) + 1
```

**Corner Bead**
```
Lineal feet = Number of corners × Height + Window/door perimeters
```

### Joint Compound

**Mud Coverage (Ready-mix)**
```
Level 4: ~0.053 gallons per sq ft
Level 5: ~0.070 gallons per sq ft

Per 4.5 gallon bucket: covers ~80-100 sq ft at Level 4
```

**By the Numbers (Per 1000 sq ft)**
| Item | Quantity |
|------|----------|
| Ready-mix mud | 5-7 buckets (4.5 gal) |
| Setting compound | 1-2 bags |
| Paper tape | 350-400 LF |
| Mesh tape | Optional for specific areas |

### Screws & Fasteners

**Screw Count**
```
Walls: 1 screw per sq ft (approximate)
Ceilings: 1.25 screws per sq ft

Or by sheet:
Screws per 4×8 sheet: ~28-32 (walls), ~40 (ceilings)
Screws per 4×12 sheet: ~42-48 (walls), ~60 (ceilings)
```

**Fastener Spacing**
```
Walls: 16" max along edges, 16" in field
Ceilings: 12" max along edges, 12" in field
```

### Labor Estimation

**Hang Time**
```
Residential: 15-20 sheets/day (2-person crew)
Commercial: 20-30 sheets/day
```

**Finish Time**
```
Level 4: ~25-35 sq ft per hour (finish work only)
Level 5: ~15-25 sq ft per hour
```

### Fire-Rated Assemblies

**Common Ratings**
| Assembly | Rating | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1-hour wall | 60 min | 5/8" Type X each side |
| 2-hour wall | 120 min | Double 5/8" Type X each side |
| 1-hour ceiling | 60 min | 5/8" Type X |
| 2-hour ceiling | 120 min | Double 5/8" Type X |

### Acoustic/Sound

**STC (Sound Transmission Class)**
```
Standard wall: STC 33-35
Staggered stud: STC 45-50
Resilient channel: STC 45-55
Double stud: STC 55-65
```

## NOTES

- Drywall finishers (tapers) are often in IUPAT (Painters union)
- Hanging vs finishing may be different crews
- Texture application is specialty skill
- Fire-rated work requires inspection
- Level 5 finish is labor-intensive and premium priced
- Large commercial jobs use drywall lift equipment
- Lead-safe certification needed for pre-1978 renovation
- Acoustic/sound work requires attention to detail
