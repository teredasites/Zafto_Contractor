## KEY FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS

### Glass Load Calculations (ASTM E1300)

**Wind Load**
```
P = 0.00256 × V² × Kz × Kd × GCp

Where:
- P = Wind pressure (psf)
- V = Wind speed (mph)
- Kz = Exposure coefficient
- Kd = Directionality factor
- GCp = Pressure coefficient
```

**Glass Thickness Selection**
```
Based on:
- Load (wind, snow, live)
- Aspect ratio (length/width)
- Support conditions
- Glass type (annealed, tempered, laminated)
- Factor of safety

Use ASTM E1300 charts or software
```

### Glass Weight

**Weight Calculation**
```
Weight (lbs) = Area (ft²) × Thickness (in) × 13.14

Or per square foot:
1/8" = 1.64 lb/ft²
3/16" = 2.45 lb/ft²
1/4" = 3.28 lb/ft²
5/16" = 4.10 lb/ft²
3/8" = 4.92 lb/ft²
1/2" = 6.54 lb/ft²
```

**Insulated Glass Unit Weight**
```
IGU Weight = Glass 1 + Airspace (negligible) + Glass 2

1" IGU (1/4 + 1/2" air + 1/4) = 6.56 lb/ft²
```

### Measurements

**Exact Opening Size**
```
Glass Size = Opening Size - Clearance

Clearances vary by frame type:
- Vinyl: 1/4" total
- Aluminum: 3/16" total
- Wood: 1/4" total
```

**Diagonal Measurement**
```
Diagonal = √(Width² + Height²)

For square check:
If diagonals equal, opening is square
```

**Daylight Opening**
```
DLO = Frame size - Frame sight line
```

### Thermal Performance

**U-Value (Insulated Glass)**
```
Lower U-value = better insulation

Single pane: ~1.0
Double pane (air): ~0.50
Double pane (argon): ~0.35
Triple pane: ~0.25
```

**Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)**
```
Range: 0 to 1
Lower = less solar heat transmitted
Clear glass: ~0.86
Low-E: ~0.25-0.40
```

### Sealant & Setting

**Sealant Joint Design**
```
Width:Depth ratio = 2:1 (ideal)
Minimum depth = 1/4"
Maximum width = movement capability
```

**Setting Block Location**
```
Position at 1/4 points from corners
Block length = glass thickness × 2 + 1/8" (min 4")
```

**Thermal Movement**
```
ΔL = α × L × ΔT

Aluminum: α = 12.8 × 10⁻⁶ in/in/°F
Glass: α = 4.7 × 10⁻⁶ in/in/°F
```

## NOTES

- Union presence through IUPAT (Painters and Allied Trades)
- Commercial glazing vs residential glass are different skill sets
- Curtain wall installation is specialty within glazing
- Safety glazing certification (SGCC) for tempered/laminated
- Auto glass is separate specialty
- Fall protection critical for high-rise work
- Large glass handling requires specialized equipment
- Hurricane/impact glazing growing market
