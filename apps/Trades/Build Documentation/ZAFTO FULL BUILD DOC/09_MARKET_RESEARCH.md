## 3. INSURANCE REGULATIONS & DOCUMENTATION

### 3A. Property Insurance Claims Lifecycle

```
FNOL (First Notice of Loss)
  → Adjuster Assignment & Inspection
  → Scope of Loss Development
  → Initial Estimate (Xactimate)
  → ACV Payment (minus deductible)
  → Contractor Engaged / Work Authorization
  → Supplements Filed (35-50% opportunity)
  → Work Performed (with documentation)
  → Completion & Final Inspection
  → RCV Holdback Released (recoverable depreciation)
  → Final Settlement
```

**Critical stat:** Average insurance scope is written for only 50-65% of actual work, leaving a 35-50% supplement opportunity.

### 3B. Three-Payer Accounting

| Payer | Description |
|---|---|
| Insurance Company | Pays ACV initially. Releases RCV holdback after completion. May pay supplements |
| Homeowner (Deductible) | Typically 1% of home value or flat ($1,000-$5,000). Collected as part of first check |
| Supplements | Additional funds for undiscovered work. Filed with documentation. Carrier must approve |

**ZAFTO needs:** Three-column invoicing tracking insurance payment, deductible, and supplement status per line item. This is a gap in virtually every FSM tool.

### 3C. ACV vs RCV (Depreciation)

| Concept | Details |
|---|---|
| ACV (Actual Cash Value) | Replacement cost minus depreciation. First payment from carrier |
| RCV (Replacement Cost Value) | Full cost to replace/repair. Requires proof of completion before full payout |
| Recoverable Depreciation | Difference between RCV and ACV. Released after work completed and documented |
| Non-Recoverable Depreciation | Some policies/items have depreciation that cannot be recovered regardless |

**Example:** $10,000 roof (20yr life, 10yr old) = $5,000 ACV initially, $5,000 recoverable depreciation released after documented replacement.

### 3D. Mortgage Company Involvement (Loss Draft Process)

| Threshold | Process |
|---|---|
| Claims <= $10,000 (loan current) | Check endorsed and 100% released immediately |
| Claims <= $40,000 (loan current) | Endorsed and released in 6-8 business days after doc package |
| Claims > $40,000 (monitored) | Initial 1/3 after docs. Second 1/3 after 50% completion inspection. Final 1/3 after completion inspection |

**Required docs:** Adjuster report, contractor estimates, signed contractor agreement, damage photos, W-9, sometimes notarized affidavits and lien releases.

**ZAFTO should:** Track loss draft status, auto-generate required doc packages, notify when to request inspections for fund release.

### 3E. State-Specific Insurance Regulations

**Florida:**
- AOB banned for policies after Jan 1, 2023 (HB 7065)
- Attorney fees: two-way (prevailing party)
- Licensed contractor requirement enforced by CILB
- Min $300,000 GL insurance, $1M+ recommended

**Texas:**
- AOB generally unenforceable
- No statewide GC license (city/county level)
- No state insurance requirements for GCs
- Can opt out of workers' comp

**California:**
- Anti-concurrent causation clauses NOT enforced (1 of 4 states)
- Strict CSLB licensing for all specialty contractors
- Strictest VOC regulations (SCAQMD Rule 1113)
- Seismic requirements, highest insurance benchmarks

**Louisiana:**
- Anti-concurrent causation enforced
- Unique civil law system (not common law)
- Direct action statute (can sue insurer directly)

### 3F. Required Insurance Documentation

**Xactimate Estimates (ESX Files):**
- Proprietary format (.esx), only openable in Xactimate
- Contains scope, regional pricing, sketch data
- XactAnalysis is the carrier-side portal for receiving/reviewing
- Sketch AR uses LiDAR for direct-to-sketch measurements

**Moisture Documentation (IICRC S500):**
- Daily moisture readings at established test locations
- Psychrometric conditions (temp, RH, GPP, dew point, vapor pressure)
- Equipment operation status and adjustments
- Baseline readings before equipment starts
- Goal readings based on dry standards

**Photo Documentation:**
- Before/during/after for every affected area
- EXIF data preservation (GPS, date/time stamps)
- Organized by room/area
- Date stamping visible or in metadata

**Drying Logs:**
- Daily entries required
- Equipment placement with serial numbers
- Environmental conditions (indoor/outdoor temp and RH)
- Hours of operation per equipment

- Before/after photos
- Material specifications
- Warranty information
- Signed by contractor and homeowner

**Content Manipulation Forms:**
- Authorization to move/store contents
- Itemized inventory with condition notes
- Storage location and access terms
- Photo of each item

**Direction to Pay vs AOB:**
- Direction to Pay: instructs carrier to name contractor on check (NOT legal assignment)
- AOB: transfers legal ownership of claim to contractor (banned/restricted in FL/TX)
- Most contractor "AOBs" are actually just directions to pay
- Critical legal distinction that software must handle correctly

**Supplements:**
- Filed when hidden/additional damage discovered during work
- Must include: photos, Xactimate line items, comparison to original scope, detailed narrative
- Approval cycle: submit → adjuster review → reinspection (sometimes) → approval/denial
- Tracking status critical for cash flow

**Third-Party Inspections (TPI):**
- Ordered by carriers to verify work quality/scope
- Carrier-specific requirements (State Farm, Allstate, USAA each different)
- Must coordinate access and timing
- Results affect final payment

### 3G. Compliance Standards

**IICRC S500 (Water Damage, 2021):**
- Categories: Cat 1 (clean), Cat 2 (gray), Cat 3 (black/sewage)
- Classes: Class 1 (least water) through Class 4 (deeply bound in hardwoods/concrete)
- Documentation: moisture mapping, psychrometric readings, equipment placement, daily progress
- Equipment sized per affected area
- Voluntary standard but adopted by virtually all carriers as requirement
