## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Zafto platform ("Service"), including the mobile application, web portals (zafto.cloud, team.zafto.cloud, client.zafto.cloud), and all related services, you ("User," "you") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Zafto is a professional-grade software platform designed for licensed tradespeople, contractors, inspectors, adjusters, real estate professionals, and homeowners. The Service provides:

- Business management tools (scheduling, invoicing, bidding, job tracking)
- Trade-specific calculators and code reference tools
- Property intelligence and estimation tools
- Inspection documentation and reporting
- Document generation and e-signature capabilities
- Communication and team management features

## 3. Professional Tool, Not Professional Advice

**3.1** The Service provides calculation tools, code references, estimation tools, inspection templates, and data aggregation to assist licensed professionals. The Service is NOT a substitute for professional engineering judgment, licensed inspections, legal counsel, tax advice, or any other professional service.

**3.2** All calculator outputs are mathematical calculations based on user-provided inputs and published formulas. Results are reference estimates intended to support — not replace — professional judgment. Users are responsible for verifying all outputs before use in design, permitting, construction, or business decisions.

**3.3** Code references (NEC, IBC, IRC, OSHA, NFPA, and others) are provided for convenience. Local jurisdictions may adopt different editions or amendments. Users must verify applicable codes with their local Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).

**3.4** Inspection templates and checklists are based on published industry standards. The Service does not perform inspections. The professional using the Service is solely responsible for inspection findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

## 4. Data Accuracy and Third-Party Data

**5.1** Estimation tools provided for contractor planning purposes are not endorsed by any insurance carrier. Estimates generated by the Service are not carrier-approved assessments and may differ from adjuster determinations.

**5.2** The Service does not process insurance claims, adjust losses, or act as an insurance intermediary. Any interaction with insurance carriers is the sole responsibility of the User.

## 6. Jurisdiction Variance

Building codes, permit requirements, licensing rules, tax rates, lien laws, and other regulations vary by jurisdiction and change over time. Users are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

## 7. User Accounts and Security

**7.1** Users must provide accurate information when creating accounts. Each User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials.
